This is puppet-lsi a puppet module for lsi hardware RAID.

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions on getting this installed.
Look in the examples/ folder for usage. If none exist, please contribute one!
This code may be a work in progress. The interfaces may change without notice.
Patches are welcome, but please be patient. They are best received by email.
Please ping me if you have big changes in mind, before you write a giant patch.

Module specific notes:
* This is more of a quick hack, than a completely finished module.
* It made sense to spend a minimum of time touching the proprietary lsi tools.
* Someone could probably write a puppet module to use megacli to manage things.
* Generally, a user will configure their initial setup manually.
* This module is useful for adding the LSI stuff on automatically on rebuilds.
* Remember to add the LSI rpm's to your local yum repository.
* LSI: If I'm not allowed to distribute the data in files/ please let me know!
* Test this to your own satisfaction before risking your data!
* I don't have any LSI gear right now. If you need support, I need hardware.
* It's possible that newer versions of the LSI tools will be released.

Dependencies:
* my puppet-shorewall module (optional)
* The LSI rpm's in your local yum repository


Happy hacking,
